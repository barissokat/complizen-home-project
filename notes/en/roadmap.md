**âœ… Achieved Results:**

- 107kB baseline bundle with 5s build time
- Zero warnings build with automated quality controls
- Production-ready foundation with comprehensive tooling
- Modern React 19 + Next.js 15 + TypeScript strict ecosystem

### Step 2 - Mock Data + Graph MVP âœ… COMPLETED

**Main Goal:** Working interactive graph

- [x] Create mock JSON file (30 devices max) âœ…
- [x] React Flow canvas setup âœ…
- [x] Dagre layout algorithm implementation âœ…
- [x] Pan/zoom/select functionality âœ…
- [x] Node coloring (by device classification) âœ…
- [x] Basic edge connections âœ…

**âœ… Achieved Results:**

- 30 realistic FDA devices with logical predicate chains across 4 generations
- Hierarchical Dagre layout with regulatory hierarchy visualization
- Interactive graph with 60fps pan/zoom/selection performance
- Color-coded nodes by device classification (Class I/II/III)
- Performance monitoring: 12ms layout time, 160kB bundle size
- Professional UX with mini-map and smooth interactions

---

### Step 3 - Search & Side Panel âœ… COMPLETED

**Main Goal:** Search + device details functionality

- [x] SearchInput component (React Hook Form) âœ…
- [x] Mock data filtering logic âœ…
- [x] DeviceDetailsPanel component âœ…
- [x] Zustand store: selectedNodeId, searchTerm âœ…
- [x] Node click â†’ panel opening âœ…
- [x] Basic responsive behavior âœ…

**âœ… Achieved Results:**

- Debounced search with 5-field filtering (K-number, name, manufacturer, class, panel)
- Professional responsive panel: desktop side panel, mobile modal
- Real graph filtering with actual node removal (not just visual hiding)
- shadcn/ui integration with color-coded device classifications
- Smart UX: input never blocked, 300ms debounce, 150ms processing
- Comprehensive device details with intended use and technical specs
- Zustand store with DevTools integration and <1ms state updates
- Bundle impact: +10.1kB total addition within performance targets

**ðŸŽ‰ MVP GUARANTEE ACHIEVED:** Phase 1 successfully completed with professional polish!

## PHASE 2: ARCHITECTURE DEPTH (Last 4 Steps)

### Step 4 - Real Data Layer

**Main Goal:** Real data integration

- [ ] Create OpenFDA API wrapper
- [ ] TanStack Query setup
- [ ] Environment toggle: mock/real data
- [ ] Error handling and loading states
- [ ] Cache configuration
- [ ] Data normalization

**Architecture Reference:** API layer, environment switching, error boundaries
**Fallback Plan:** API limit problems â†’ continue with mock data

---

### Step 5 - UI/UX & Responsiveness

**Main Goal:** Professional polish

- [ ] DashboardLayout template
- [ ] Dark mode toggle implementation
- [ ] Mobile responsive breakpoints
- [ ] Graph toolbar (reset zoom, center)
- [ ] Graph legend component
- [ ] Visual improvements and animations

**Detailed Tasks:**

- [ ] d3-force Web Worker draft (>500 nodes)
- [ ] Classification and date range filters
- [ ] (Optional) mobile touch gestures and graph export

**Architecture Reference:** Atomic Design foundation, theme provider, responsive patterns
**Fallback Plan:** Horizontal scroll acceptable for mobile

---

### Step 6 - Quality Barrier

**Main Goal:** Testing and code quality

- [ ] Vitest setup and configuration
- [ ] 4-5 core component tests
- [ ] Playwright E2E test: search â†’ node click â†’ panel
- [ ] Bundle analyzer setup
- [ ] Code refactoring and cleanup
- [ ] Type safety improvements

**Detailed Tasks:**

- [ ] At least 5 component tests with Vitest + Testing Library
- [ ] Playwright "search â†’ select node â†’ panel" scenario
- [ ] ESLint, Prettier, `tsc --noEmit` clean pass
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow: install â†’ lint â†’ type-check â†’ test â†’ build

**Architecture Reference:** Test strategy, E2E scenarios, performance monitoring
**Fallback Plan:** Coverage below 60% acceptable, but E2E must work

---

### Step 7 - Deploy + Documentation

**Main Goal:** Production deployment

- [ ] Vercel deployment setup
- [ ] Environment variables configuration
- [ ] README final update
- [ ] Architecture decisions documentation
- [ ] Demo screenshots
- [ ] Performance metrics documentation

**Detailed Tasks:**

- [ ] Production deploy to Vercel (working with mock data)
- [ ] Lighthouse / bundle size quick check
- [ ] Update README with architectural decisions and "next steps" section
- [ ] Prepare demo scenarios and talking points

**Architecture Reference:** Deployment config, comprehensive docs
**Fallback Plan:** Skip demo video, production link is essential

---

### Step 8 - Final Polish

**Main Goal:** Presentation prep

- [ ] Lighthouse performance audit
- [ ] Self-review and code cleanup
- [ ] Demo scenarios preparation
- [ ] Interview talking points
- [ ] Screenshots and demo links

**Interview Prep:** Technical decisions, future roadmap, challenges faced
