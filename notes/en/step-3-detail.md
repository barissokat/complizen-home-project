## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### State Management Implementation

```typescript
// Zustand Store Structure
interface GraphStore {
  selectedNodeId: string | null;
  searchTerm: string;
  filteredDevices: FDADevice[];
  isSearching: boolean;

  // Enhanced Actions
  setSelectedNode: (id: string | null) => void;
  performSearch: (term: string) => void;
  setFilteredDevices: (devices: FDADevice[]) => void;
  setIsSearching: (loading: boolean) => void;
  clearSelection: () => void;
  clearSearch: () => void;
  resetStore: () => void;
}

// DevTools Integration
const useGraphStore = create<GraphStore>()(
  devtools(
    (set, get) => ({
      // Store implementation with debugging support
    }),
    { name: "graph-store" },
  ),
);
```

### Search System Architecture

```typescript
// Enhanced Search Implementation
const filterDevices = (devices: FDADevice[], searchTerm: string) => {
  if (!searchTerm || searchTerm.length < 2) return devices;

  const searchLower = searchTerm.toLowerCase();
  return devices.filter(
    (device) =>
      device.kNumber.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
      device.deviceName.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
      device.manufacturer.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
      device.productClass.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
      (device.panelType?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ?? false),
  );
};

// Debounced Search with Smart UX
const debouncedSearch = useMemo(
  () =>
    debounce((term: string) => {
      setIsSearching(true);
      // Process search without blocking input
      const filtered = filterDevices(mockDevices, term);
      setFilteredDevices(filtered);
      setIsSearching(false);
    }, 300),
  [],
);
```

### Component Architecture

```typescript
// Atomic Design Implementation
/src/components/
├── atoms/ui/           // shadcn/ui components
│   ├── Button.tsx     // Enhanced with variants
│   ├── Input.tsx      // Form integration ready
│   └── Badge.tsx      // Color-coded classifications
├── molecules/
│   └── SearchInput.tsx // Debounced search with validation
└── organisms/
    └── DeviceDetailsPanel.tsx // Responsive professional panel
```

### Phase 2C: Debounced Search Implementation (25 minutes)

```typescript
// Smart Debouncing Strategy
useEffect(() => {
  const searchTerm = watch("searchTerm");

  if (searchTerm !== undefined) {
    debouncedSearch(searchTerm);
  }
}, [watch("searchTerm"), debouncedSearch]);

// UX Optimization: Input never blocked during search
const inputDisabled = false; // Always keep input responsive
```
